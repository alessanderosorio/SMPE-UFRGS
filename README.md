# SMPE-UFRGS

This is my final work for UFRGS SMPE Lecture 

The attached article was an enlarged version of the original WSCAD document, which is already accepted for publications in the Computer Science and Information Communications (CCIS / Springer) series.

In this paper we analysed data from 18 years from this conference. In order to accomplish other steps from my Master Degree  work, this work was reproduced in another international conference: the SBAC-PAD. 

For the final work for this lecture, I intend to reproduce the analysis of the  WSCAD paper using the knowledge accured form the lecture on the SBAC-PAD data set.
