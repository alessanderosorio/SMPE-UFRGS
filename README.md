# SMPE-UFRGS

This is my final work for UFRGS SMPE Lecture 

The abstract below, is part of an enlarged version of the original WSCAD paper, which is already accepted for publications in the Computer Science and Information Communications (CCIS / Springer) series.

In this paper we analysed data from 18 years from this conference according with the abstract.  

For the final work for this lecture, I intend to reproduce the analysis of the  WSCAD paper using the knowledge accured.

"Title - Tangible assets to improve research quality: a meta analysis case study"

"Abstract - This paper presents a meta-analysis of the publications from all 18 previous editions of WSCAD in order to understand how performance results are validated and reported. This meta-analysis extract from these papers terms (keywords) belonging to three categories: statistics, metrics and tests. From all 426 papers analyzed, 93% referred at least one of the terms considered, indicating that there is a concern that results should be reported in order to the paper be considered relevant for this conference. Nevertheless, this analysis shows that only 3% of the papers applies reliable statistical tests to validate them. This paper depicts the meta-analysis achieved and proposes a direction to promote the adoption of a guideline to improve the results reporting in this conference and other with related subjects."
